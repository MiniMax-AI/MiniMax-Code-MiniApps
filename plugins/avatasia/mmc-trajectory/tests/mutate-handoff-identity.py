"""Mutation control for the session the handoff names.

The handoff reads two things asynchronously — the record's untouched message and its four bulk
fields — and the page can be showing another conversation by the time they answer. The report it
hands to the Host NAMES the session, so the session has to be the one the selected record came
from, captured before the reads and not looked up after them.

Reading it after them is what the first mutation below does, and it does it with getters rather
than with a moved line: the object handed to the markdown is captured, but its fields are read
when the markdown is built — which is after the reads have answered, and by then the page may be
showing somebody else's conversation. The getter is not how anyone writes code; it is how this
one defect is reproduced in a single edit, so the control cannot be satisfied by an
implementation that merely happens to look right.

The second mutation is the blunter half: no session at all.

Both have to be caught by the same named assertion in client-check.mjs, which runs the shipped
`handoffSelected` over a deferred raw read and moves the page while that read is in flight.

Every case names the rule it is about in its `expect` field, and a case counts as caught only
when the probe reported THAT rule: a probe that went red on some other assertion has not shown
that this guard owns this mutation.
